## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **Storage Upload Fix (Manual Setup Needed):**

The upload error `pjhrogdbzpqnxhfxxmsb.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/shift-admin/projects/...` with status 400 is because the Supabase storage bucket lacks proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies.

**Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pjhrogdbzpqnxhfxxmsb
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** Storage → Policies

3. **Create 4 policies** (follow the detailed instructions in `setup-storage-policies.sh`)

4. **Create admin account:**
   - Visit `/admin` 
   - Sign up with `dirkawspy@gmail.com`
   - Confirm email and sign in

5. **Test uploads** - Should work without errors

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### **Favicon Fix:**
- ✅ `public/favicon.svg` - SVG favicon with green branding

- ✅ `app/layout.tsx` - Added favicon metadata

### **Storage Setup:**
- ✅ `setup-storage-policies.sh` - Executable setup instructions
- ✅ `STORAGE_FIX_GUIDE.md` - Detailed documentation

Once you complete the storage policy setup:
