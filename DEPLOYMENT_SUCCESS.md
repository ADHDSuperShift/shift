## 🔧 Why Automatic Deployment Didn't Work

Possible reasons:
1. **Vercel webhook delay** - Sometimes takes a few minutes
2. **GitHub integration** - May need to reconnect
3. **Deployment settings** - Auto-deploy might be disabled

## ✅ Solution Applied

✅ **Manual deployment using Vercel CLI**
- Command: `vercel --prod`
- Status: Successfully deployed
- Your site is now live!

## 🔄 Fix Automatic Deployments (Optional)

To ensure future pushes auto-deploy:

### 1. Check Vercel Git Integration
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/adhdsupershifts-projects/shift/settings/git
2. Verify GitHub is connected
3. Check "Auto Deploy" is enabled for `main` branch

### 2. Verify GitHub Webhook
1. Go to: https://github.com/ADHDSuperShift/shift/settings/hooks
2. Look for Vercel webhook
3. Check recent deliveries are successful

### 3. Project Settings
1. Dashboard: https://vercel.com/adhdsupershifts-projects/shift
2. Settings → Git
3. Enable "Production Branch: main"
4. Enable "Preview Deployments"

## 📊 Deployment Summary

- **Commit:** 87fdd78
- **Branch:** main
- **Build Time:** ~7 seconds
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE
- **Method:** Manual (Vercel CLI)

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Visit your live site** and test all features
2. **Run database migration** in Supabase (drop testimonials table)
3. **Optional:** Set up custom domain in Vercel
4. **Optional:** Fix automatic deployments for future updates

## 🗄️ Database Migration (Still Needed)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read" ON testimonials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public insert" ON testimonials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public update" ON testimonials;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public delete" ON testimonials;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS testimonials;
```
